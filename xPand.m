(*** BOOLEANS ***)

BackgroundFieldMethod::usage = "BackgroundFieldMethod is a boolean option, set by default to 'False'. If set to 'True', then only the first order of the metric perturbation is kept, and it therefore stands for the total metric perturbation. 

This option should be placed at the begining of the notebook, right after loading the xPand package.";
(* Recently implemented. Does not work correctly. CP needs to fix that. To be checked... *)

$CacheRules::usage = "If set to 'True', the rules are remembered. This is potentially dangerous, so default is 'False'.";
(* This is obsolete. This will have to be erased. *)

$ConformalTime::usage = "If set to 'True' (default value), then the prime ' stands for the Lie derivative along the vector 'n' normal to the spatial slices. If the time coordinate is taken to be the proper time of the Eulerian observers (identified by the normal vector), then the Lie derivative along 'n' corresponds to the partial time derivative with respect to the conformal time, namely: \!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(\[ScriptCapitalL]\), \(n\)]\) .. = \[PartialD]/\[PartialD]\[Eta] .. . 

The second Label-Index (LI) of projected tensors represents the number of Lie derivatives along 'n' that are applied to them. It also corresponds to the number of partial derivatives with respect to conformal time. 

In the cases for which we prefer to use the cosmic time, we can choose to employ the second LI not for the number of \!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(\[ScriptCapitalL]\), \(n\)]\), but rather for the number of 1/a \!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(\[ScriptCapitalL]\), \(n\)]\), where 'a' is the scale factor. This is done by setting '$ConformalTime' to 'False'. The label index then indicates a derivative with respect to cosmic time.

The output format of the second LI is a prime for a conformal time derivative, and a dot for a cosmic time derivative.";

$FirstOrderVectorPerturbations::usage = "Boolean option to decide if first order vector modes should be included. Default is 'True'.";

(*** ERROR MESSAGES ***)

(********** The following error message does not seem correct. It should be modified. **********)

SetSlicing::signature = "The signature of the metric `1` should be -1 in order to perform a (N-1)+1 background splitting along a time-like vector. This comes from the fact that in the current version, the norm of the time-like vectors is fixed to -1.";

Given a background manifold of dimension 'N' and an ambient metric 'g' on that manifold, this function performs a (N-1)+1 slicing. 

More precisely, it builds the induced metric 'h' on the hypersurfaces, the associated covariant derivative 'cd', and the vector 'n' normal to these hypersurfaces. It also sets the type 'SpaceTimeType' for the hypersurfaces. The latter argument can take a value among {Anisotropic, BianchiB, BianchiA, BianchiI, FLCurved, FLFlat, Minkowski}. The norm 'nNorm' of the vector 'n' is set by default to -1 if omitted.";

Conformal::usage = "Conformal[metricfinal][metric1,metric2][expr] performs a conformal transformation of 'expr' from 'metric1' to 'metric2' and expresses the result in terms of 'metricfinal' (along with its associated covariant derivative and curvature tensors). If needed, the function first reformulates 'expr' in terms of 'metric1'. The two metrics 'metric1' and 'metric2' have to be conformally related by DefConformalMetric. 

Conformal[metric1,metric2][expr] provides the final result with respect to the ambient metric, which is the first metric defined on the manifold.";

ConformalWeight::usage = "ConformalWeight[tensor[inds]] specifies the power of the conformal factor applied in the conformal transformation of the tensor 'tensor'. It corresponds to the number of down indices, minus the number of up indices, plus the quantity ConformalWeight[tensor] (without the indices). The latter is set by default to zero. 

For instance, in the setting ConformalWeight[tensor] = 0, we have: ConformalWeight[tensor[\[Alpha],\[Beta]]] = -2, and ConformalWeight[tensor[-\[Alpha],-\[Beta]]] = 2.";

DefConformalMetric::usage = "DefConformalMetric[g,S] defines a metric conformally related to 'g', with the conformal factor 'S'. The new metric is named 'gS2', and its inverse is given by 'Inv[gS2]'. If other metrics are conformally related to 'g', then 'gS2' is related to them by transitivity of the conformal transformation. 

When calling the function SetSlicing, the conformal factor is chosen to be the scale factor 'a[h]' (or, equivalently, 'ah'). The constructed metric 'gah2' then corresponds to the 'real' background metric (i.e. the one that would be obtained from the physical metric of the manifold).";

DefMetricFields::usage = "DefMetricFields[g,gpert,h,parameter] defines the perturbed metric 'gpert' from its background value 'g'. The argument 'h' is the induced metric on the spatial hypersurfaces, and the optional argument 'parameter' (set by default to \[Epsilon]) is the symbol used in the perturbative expansions. Several tensors that are used to decompose 'gpert' are defined when calling this function.";

'Name' refers to the name of the tensor, and 'inds' (which has to be with down indices) defines its rank. The argument 'h' is the induced metric on the spatial hypersurfaces. 

There exist 3 types of options. 

The first type is: 'TensorProperties', by default set to 'Transverse', 'Traceless' and 'SymmetricTensor'. These can be overwritten with 'TensorProperties->ListOfProperties', where 'ListOfProperties' is a list whose elements can be: 'Transverse', 'Traceless' and 'SymmetricTensor'. 

The second option is: 'SpaceTimesOfDefinition', by default set to 'Background' and 'Perturbed'. These can be also overwritten with 'SpaceTimesOfDefinition->SpaceTimesList', where 'SpaceTimesList' is a list whose elements can be: 'Background' and 'Perturbed'.

'ListOfProjectors' is a list whose elements are among: 'Time' (or, equivalently, '*NameOfNormalVector*') and 'Space' (or, equivalently, '*NameOfInducedMetric*'). The length of the list has to equal the rank of the tensors of 'expr'. The free indices (in canonical order) of 'expr' are then projected according to the 'ListOfProjectors'. 

'ListOfFreeIndices' is the list of free indices on which the ListOfProjectors is to be applied. If this is omitted, then it is the list of free indices in alphabetic order. 

When the argument 'ListOfProjectors' is omitted, all the projections for rank-0 to rank-2 tensors are displayed in a table.";

'normuf' is the squared norm of the four-velocity 'uf' (usually taken as -1), and the optional argument 'tiltspecification' (set by default to 'NotTilted') allows for a tilt between the fluid four-velocity and the vector normal to the hypersurfaces.
